Crowdflower provides a number of download options for results. I've listed them below along with their descriptions (from cf's gui). 
Additionally, cf allows you to either include or exclude untrusted judgments (judgments from people who got kicked out of the study 
eventually for failing too many embedded test questions--in this case when their accuracy fell below 50%).
