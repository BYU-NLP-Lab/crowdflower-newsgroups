Creates an annotation stream dataset 
by postprocessing the items in the results folder.

The resulting annotation stream has 
the following structure:

[
    # An annotated instance
    {   batch: 123
        source: "http://document/id",
        data: "The text of the first document",
        label: "TrueLabel",
        annotator: "george",
`       annotation: "SomeLabel"
        "startTime":1319123,
        "endTime":1319198}
    },
    etc...
]

If 'batch' is set, this annotation was received as part 
of a batch of annotations sharing this number. 
Annotations in the same batch are reported consecutively.

startTimeSecs and endTimeSecs are utc timestamps (number 
of secs since 1 Jan 1970))
