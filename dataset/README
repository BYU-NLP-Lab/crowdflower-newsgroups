Creates an annotation stream dataset 
by postprocessing the items in the results folder.

The resulting annotation stream has 
the following structure:

[
    # An annotated instance
    {   batch: 123
        source: "http://document/id",
        data: "The text of the first document",
        label: "TrueLabel",
        annotator: "george",
`       annotation: "SomeLabel"
        "startTime":1319123,
        "endTime":1319198}
    },
    etc...
]

If 'batch' is set, this annotation was received as part 
of a batch of annotations sharing this number. 
Annotations in the same batch are reported consecutively.

The "data" attribute may optionally be replaced by "datapath", which gives 
a relative path to a file that contains the data, which is 
convenient for data that contains punctuation that makes it 
awkward to embed inside json.

startTimeSecs and endTimeSecs are utc timestamps (number 
of secs since 1 Jan 1970))
