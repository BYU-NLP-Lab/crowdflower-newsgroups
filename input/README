use the following process to get a re-annotated portion of the newsgroups corpus:

1) newsgroups2csv.py
   convert newsgroups to a single big csv table (newsgroups.csv). Cols include 
  "index" = relative path to the original document (e.g., groups/alt.atheism/29234)
  "category_gold" = contains the correct label for text questions only

2) instancechooser.py
   split all.csv into two parts: included.csv (all the rows to be included in the crowdflower (CF) experiment), and excluded.csv (other rows). Included will include 1,000 instances, plus 10 test instances per class.

3) newsgroups2humanreadable.py
   create a human-readable version of the data that was chosen to be included in step #2 and put it in a web-accessible place (nlp.cs.byu.edu/~plf1/newsgroups/. this will be referenced from the crowdflower task so that we don't have to try to embed unpredictable data (escaping punctuation, newlines, etc) in the csv we upload to crowdflower. N.B. The human readable data will be indexed not by the typical file/folder path, since that contains clues as to the true label, but by a rot13 version of the file/folder path.

4) process included.csv on CF. Download csv with all judgments on each item (including test questions): newsgroups-annotated.csv

5) 
  combine newsgroups-annotated.csv and excluded.csv into a single big-ol' json stream suitable for use with LearningCurve.java
